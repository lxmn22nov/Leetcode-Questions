/*
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where
 * quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage
 * expectation for the ith worker.
 * 
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k
 * workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
 * 
 * Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage
 * expectation.
 * In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their
 * quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in
 * the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid
 * group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual
 * answer will be accepted.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
 * Output: 105.00000
 * Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3
 * Output: 30.66667
 * Explanation: We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers
 * separately.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * n == quality.length == wage.length
 * 1 <= k <= n <= 104
 * 1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 104
