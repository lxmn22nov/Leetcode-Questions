/*
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a
 * cycle in it.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
 * be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos
 * is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected
 * to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * 
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to
 * the 1st node (0-indexed).
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to
 * the 0th node.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
