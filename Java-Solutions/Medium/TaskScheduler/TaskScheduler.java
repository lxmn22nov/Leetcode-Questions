/*
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and
 * a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task.
 * Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical
 * tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
 * 
 * â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A
 * ->B.
 * 
 * After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The
 * same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so
 * you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
 * With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other
 * task.
