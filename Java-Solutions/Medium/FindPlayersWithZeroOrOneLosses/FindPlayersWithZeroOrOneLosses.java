/*
 * You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]
 * indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
 * 
 * Return a list answer of size 2 where:
 * 
 * answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
 * answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
 * The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
 * The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same
 * outcome.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: matches =
 * [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
 * Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
 * Explanation:
 * Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
 * Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
 * Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
 * Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
